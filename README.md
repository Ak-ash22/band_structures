# band_structures

This repo examines and reproduces the pseudopotential formfactors and electronic band structures for 14 semiconductors of the diamond and zincblend structures: AISb, CdTe, GaAs, GaP, GaSb, Ge, InAs, InP,
InSb, Si, Sn, ZnS, ZnSe, and ZnTe. The study employs one of the empirical pseudopotential method, renowned for its accuracy and efficiency in crystalline solid state physics discussed in the paper by Cohen and Bergstresser[1] in 1966. The Brillouin zone paths are mapped to ensure a thorough exploration of the electronic states along the specified directions. This paper aims to compute, compare and analyze the bandstructures thereby validating the method used.
